# Работа с git и bash

## Bash
Bash scripts are used for a range of tasks, from simple commands to complex programs with conditional operations, loops, and function calls. Working through the command line makes it easier and faster for the user to interact with the system, without using a GUI.
      Commands for working with files and folders:

## Task 1
```
cd ~                                     # Open the home directory
pwd                                      # Determine the name of the folder you are in
mkdir test3                              # Create a folder test3
cd test3                                 # Go to test3  ```
